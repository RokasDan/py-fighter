#### Contributions of each group member, along with references and where we got our inspiration

## Robert Soane
### Major Code Contributions
I wrote the *majority or all* of following files
#### Character, Player and NPC
I produced the Character, Player and NPC classes.  The Player and NPC's inherit from Character, and most of the methods are in the Character class.  There are some differences in NPC, such as the automated moving and attacking.
#### Text
I produced the Text rendering and plotting class.  I took inspiration from the Pygame documentation.
#### Menu
#### Spritesheet
### Minor Code Contributions
I *contributed* towards the following files
#### Controller
I wrote the update function in the controller.
#### Map
I implemented the initial version of the Tile sprite class which is in the map.py file.  I based this on my code from Character.
#### Weapon
I helped implement the initial arm-moving part of the weapon class through paired programming.  Shaylen did the majority of the work.
### Graphics
I produced very little in terms of graphics.  I modified a few spritesheets to ensure the dimensions matched, and I produced the blank button graphics based on Rokas' tile designs.
### Audio
I produced a prototype music track on beep box.
