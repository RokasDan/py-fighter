# Pyfighter (working title)
## A Steampunk 2D streetfighting game built with PyGame.

A long time ago in a a galaxy far, far away there existed in person tuition.  But in the year 2020, COVID struck.  All semester modules have been 100% online and you haven't seen your professors.  So do they exist?  Are they just a figment of your imagination?

To cut costs, the university created AI professors to deliver your lectures and set your coursework.  Exam season approaches and the evil Darth Virus has hacked your professors, multiplying them and making your exams harder.

Only you can save your degree...

Pyfighter is an 8-bit side scrolling, infinite level platform game, produced in python using PyGame as part on an MSc by R. Soane, R. Danevicius, and S. Mistry.  Inspired by super street fighter, super smash bros and Mario, they created a customisable and addictive game that gets progressively harder.
