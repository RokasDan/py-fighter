### Installation
To play Pyfighter you need the following installations on your system

Python 3, with version >= 3.8.5
PyGame version >= 2.0.0

#### Windows
Download python from the downloads page of the python website.

To install pygame (required to play the game), run `pip install pygame` from the command line. This will install the latest version of pygame.

If you already have an older version of pygame installed on your computer you will need to upgrade it to play.  To do this, run `pip install pygame==2.0.0`

The game can then be run by running pyfighter.py from the projects root directory, or by double clicking the pyfighter.py icon from within Windows explorer.

#### Linux
Pyfighter has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, but should run on other flavours of linux.

Ensure python3 is installed on your system, if it is not installed, run `sudo apt-get install python3`, or use your favourite package manager.

To install pygame, run `pip3 install pygame`

To give execute permissions, make sure to run `chmod +x pyfighter.py`

Run `python3 pyfighter.py` from the projects root directory.
#### Mac OS
We have been unable to test this project on Mac OS, however as it has been tested on various flavours of Linux we see no reason why it should fail on a mac.
Ensure python3 and pygame 2 are installed.
